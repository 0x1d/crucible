# Alchemist Integration

**Planned** P-06.

The alchemist Claude host becomes the athanor agent.
It writes frontend components to athanor storage and backend services as Elixir codex entries.
Components call published services through a call-only gateway.

## Slices

### 1. Agent sidecar

- The alchemist Claude host runs as its own Node process. Alchemist does not run under Bun.
- The sidecar exposes one HTTP endpoint that streams a session over SSE.
- `/api/agents` proxies to the sidecar and replaces `generateModuleFromPrompt`.
- The agent panel renders streamed messages in the conversation tab.
- Config: `NSHDE_AGENT_URL` (sidecar base URL).

### 2. Component entries

Codex entries under `functions/nshde/` that call the athanor storage API:

- `nshde.component.write` - write `components/<slug>.nsh.tsx`. The preview hot-mounts it.
- `nshde.component.read` / `nshde.component.list`
- `nshde.component.check` - compile with Sucrase on the athanor side and return errors.

athanor adds `POST /api/modules/check` for the compile step.

### 3. Service gateway

- A service is a codex entry under `functions/services/<name>/`.
- Its `meta.json` carries `service.input_schema` and `service.output_schema` (JSON Schema).
- Published services are listed in a manifest of `{ slug, source_sha256 }`. Publish is an action in the athanor UI.
- `Runtime.ServiceGateway` is a second BEAM listener. It accepts only `call`, only for manifest slugs whose current `source_sha256` matches.
- Each call validates input and output against the schemas and runs in a task with a timeout and `max_heap_size`.
- athanor exposes `POST /api/services/:slug`, which forwards to the gateway.
- The explorer lists services (read-only).

### 4. Service binding in the preview

- The loader allows a virtual module `@nshde/services` with `call(slug, args)` and `useService(slug, args)`.
- A component declares `export const capabilities = ["service:<slug>"]`.
- The IDE mints a short-lived token scoped to those slugs and passes it to the preview. `/api/services/:slug` checks it.
- CORS is limited to the IDE origin.
- TypeScript types for service calls are generated from the schemas.

## Status

- Sidecar: alchemist `hosts/nshde/sidecar.ts` (`POST /sessions`, SSE), built on the Claude host's `alchemistOptions()`. athanor proxies `/api/agents` to it; the stub generator is gone.
- Component entries: `functions/nshde/component/{write,read,list,check}`, sharing `AgentLib.Nshde`. `write` checks first and refuses a source with errors.
- Gateway: `Runtime.ServiceGateway`, the last child of `Runtime.Application`, with schema validation, a task per call, a timeout, and `max_heap_size`. The manifest is `<state dir>/services.json`; athanor writes it on Publish. `define` keeps a service's `service` block in `meta.json`.
- Binding: `@nshde/services` in the loader, `export const capabilities`, tokens from `POST /api/service-tokens` in the preview URL fragment, origin policy in `src/lib/api/origin.ts`, and `components/services.d.ts` generated on publish.
- Verified: the real gateway and athanor server together refuse unpublished slugs (403), changed sources (409), and missing or foreign tokens (401/403); a component in an opaque sandboxed preview renders the service's data. The prompt-to-component-and-service run needs Claude credentials for the sidecar and is not yet run.

## Out of scope

Running services on a separate BEAM node, signed packages.

## Done when

- A prompt produces a component and a service; the component renders in the preview and shows data from the service.
- `/api/services/:slug` refuses unpublished slugs, changed sources, and calls without a matching token.
